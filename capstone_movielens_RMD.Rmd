# Introduction

**Summary.** This project compares several methods for predicting movie ratings. The goal of this project was to identify a modeling approach or an ensemble of modeling approaches that predicted movie ratings with a root mean squared error (RMSE) < 0.86490. Four machine learning (ML) methods were compared: regularization, stepwise regression on k-modes cluster averages, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests. The regularization method performed the best. **The regularization method had a final *RMSE of 0.86434*, which achieved the project goal's of obtaining an RMSE < 0.86490.** The regularization method alone performed better than any other individual method or any ensemble method examined here. Computationally, regularization was the simplest ML method examined, which demonstrated the broader ML adage that increasing computational complexity does not necessarily improve model performance.

**Motivation.** Movies have become a pervasive part of modern culture.  As the popularity of movies has grown, so has the number and diversity of movies available to viewers.  Recommending movies to viewers based on their preferences has become a valuable tool for helping viewers find enjoyable cinema.  In 2009, Netflix launched a competition for data scientists to create a model to improve Netflix's movie recommendation system, and this competition served as the inspiration for many educational projects to train aspiring data scientists on how to create and compare ML methods. This report was a capstone deliverable for the HarvardX Data Science certificate.  

# Data Cleaning and Setup   

**Data Pre-processing.** The data in this project were drawn from a sample of the MovieLens dataset, which included variables for: user ID, movie title, a list of the movie's genres, the movie's numerical identifier, the year the movie premiered, the time that the rating was given, and the rating that the viewer gave the movie. Our goal was to accurately predict movie ratings.

The models were trained and tested on training and test sets created from the "edx" dataset. Then, the trained models were applied to a separate set of observations (the validation data) that were not used to train the model. The train and test partitions of the edx dataset contained 80% and 20% of the edx observations, respectively. 

```{r, echo=T, message=F,warning=F,eval=F}
#create index identifying the observations selected for the training dataset
train_index <- createDataPartition(edx$title, times = 1, p=.8, list = F)

#use the index and its inverse to create training and test sets
train <- edx[train_index,]
test <- edx[-train_index,]
```

The following code was used to parse the movie title column into title and year, and also to clean the data to make it more computationally efficient and statistically useful.

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#creates columns with the movie year and rating year
edx[["movie_year"]] <- as.numeric(str_sub(edx$title,-5,-2))
edx<-edx %>% mutate(rating_year = year(as_datetime(timestamp)))
validation[["movie_year"]] <- as.numeric(str_sub(validation$title,-5,-2))
validation <- validation %>% mutate(rating_year = year(as_datetime(timestamp)))

#remove all dashes in the genres column. this will help the code run quickly 
edx$genres<-gsub("-", "", edx$genres)
validation$genres<-gsub("-", "", validation$genres)

#convert several of the columns to factors for computational efficiency
edx[["movieId"]]<-as.factor(edx[["movieId"]])
edx[["title"]]<-as.factor(edx[["title"]])
edx[["genres"]]<-as.factor(edx[["genres"]])

#repeat the process for the validation data 
validation[["movieId"]]<-as.factor(validation[["movieId"]])
validation[["title"]]<-as.factor(validation[["title"]])
validation[["genres"]]<-as.factor(validation[["genres"]])

#change factor levels of the validation set to match the edx data factor levels 
levels(validation$movieId)<-levels(edx$movieId)
levels(validation$title)<-levels(edx$title)
levels(validation$genres)<-levels(edx$genres)
```

The "genres" column in the original data contained a concatenated list of all the genres which apply to each movie. The following code was used to split this genres column into a series of boolean columns--one boolean column for each possible genre.  This laid the ground work for performing clustering analysis of the genres, as described later in the report.

```{r echo=T, message=F, warning=F }
#create a list of all the entries in the data's original "genres" column
genre_levels<-levels(as.factor(edx$genres))

#split this list into a list of individual genres
splits<-sapply(genre_levels, function(g){
  strsplit(g,"[|]")[[1]]
})

#remove duplicate genres from the list created earlier 
genres<-unique(unlist(splits, use.names=F))

#create a matrix listing each unique movie and the genres for each movie
titles_genres<-distinct(select(edx,c("title","genres")),title, .keep_all = T)
genres_matrix<-data.frame(unique(titles_genres$title))
names(genres_matrix)<-"title"
for (genre in genres){
  
  #append a new column that indicates if the movie in each row is in the genre
  genres_matrix[[genre]] <-str_detect(titles_genres$genres,genre)
}
```
```{r, echo=F}
#delete the column with "no genres listed"
genres_matrix<- suppressMessages(select(genres_matrix,-c("(no genres listed)")))

#append the boolean genre columns to edx and validation datasets
edx <- left_join(edx, genres_matrix, by="title")
validation <- left_join(validation, genres_matrix, by="title")
```

**Computer Setup.** The code for this project was written in R-4.0.1 and run on a Microsoft Azure virtual machine with 64GB RAM and 3.5 GHz processor. Most but not all of the R code for this project is printed in this report. The full R code is available in the accompanying .R file.

# Exploratory Analysis   

**Descriptive Statistics for the Edx Dataset.** The training and test datasets included a total of 10,676 distinct movies that premiered between 1915 and 2008, `r length(unique(edx$userId))` distinct users, and `r nrow(edx)` distinct ratings given by users.  The "genres" column in the data contained a list of genres applicable for each movie. Possible rating levels ranged from 0.5 stars to 5.0 stars in increments of 0.5 stars. 

For the edx dataset which was used for training and testing, the average movie rating was `r mean(edx$rating)` with SD=`r sd(edx$rating)`. For the validation dataset, the average movie rating was `r mean(validation$rating)` with SD=`r sd(validation$rating)`. The distributions of ratings for the edx and validation datasets were compared using the graphs below. The graphs showed that the edx and validation datasets had very similar rating distributions. 

```{r echo=F, results='asis', message=F, warning=F}
#create histogram of ratings for edx dataset
ggplot(edx,aes(rating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5) +
  labs(x="Rating",y="Count",
       title="Distribution of Ratings in the Edx Dataset") +
  theme_grey()

#create histogram of ratings for validation dataset
ggplot(validation,aes(rating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5) +
  labs(x="Rating",y="Count",
       title="Distribution of Ratings in the Validation Dataset") +
  theme_grey()
```

**Differences in Average Ratings For Each Genre.** Based on the table below, it was clear that different genres tended to have different average movie ratings.  The genres that received the highest ratings were Film-Noir, Documentary, War, Imax, and Mystery.  The genres that received the lowest ratings were Horror, Sci-Fi, Children's films, Action, and Comedy.  The average rating for the lowest-rated genre (Horror) was 0.742 starts below the average rating of the highest-rated genre (Film-Noir).  This was almost one standard of deviation (SD = 1.06) difference between the highest and lowest rated genres, suggesting a movie's membership in certain genres might have affected the movie's average rating.  This initial observation that a movie's membership in specific genres might affect its average rating helped motivate the design of the ML methods presented later in this report.  However, the graph below showed that the standard deviations of ratings for each genre overlap, suggesting the differences in average ratings across genres might not be statistically significant, so further analysis was warranted. The red horizontal line in the graph below shows the global rating average for the training data. The size of the dots is proportional to the number of movies in each genre in the training data.

```{r echo=F, results='asis', message=F, warning=F}
#get highest rated genre groups
highest_rated <- edx %>% group_by(genres) %>% 
  summarise(avg_rating=mean(rating), n=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_rating))
 
#get lowest rated genre groups
lowest_rated <- edx %>% group_by(genres) %>% 
  summarise(avg_rating=mean(rating), n=n()) %>% 
  arrange(avg_rating)

#delete "no genres listed" from genres list
genres<-genres[which(genres!="(no genres listed)")]

#create a table with the average rating, sd of the ratings, and n per genre
ratings<-sapply(genres,function(genre){
  edx %>% filter(str_detect(genres,genre)==1) %>% 
    summarize(mean=mean(rating), sd=sd(rating),n=n())
})

#convert the table to a dataframe for easy retrieval 
ratings<-data.frame(ratings)
ratings["genre",]<-names(ratings)

#transpose the descriptive statistics so we can sort it more easily 
ratings_sortable<-data.frame()
for (rating_ in ratings){
  ratings_sortable<-rbind(ratings_sortable,rating_)
}

#create a table with the genres from highest to lowest average rating
ratings_table<-ratings_sortable %>% arrange(desc(mean))
#kable(ratings_table, caption="Descriptive Statistics by Genre")

#create graph showing average, SD, and number of the ratings for each genre
ggplot(ratings_table, aes(x=reorder(genre, -mean), y=mean,
                          color=reorder(genre, -mean))) +
  geom_point(aes(size=n), show.legend = F) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean-sd, ymax = mean+sd), width = 0.5, 
                size = 0.5, show.legend=F) +
  labs(x="Genre", y="Average Rating and SD", 
       title="Average Ratings, SD, and Number of Observations by Genre") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) 

#create copy of the genres list for future reference
genres_<-genres
```

**Correlations Between Ratings and Genres.** The likelihood of a causal-link between a movie's membership in certain genres and that movie's average rating was further established by calculating the pairwise correlations between genres and ratings. Pearson's pairwise correlation coefficient is a common, easily interpreted method for estimating the extent to which two variables co-vary.  The Pearson correlation coefficient can be thought of as the percent of two variables' variance that is correlated (i.e., the percent of variance that co-varies). Columns for genres with a low absolute correlation to movies' ratings were excluded from the ML models because these columns appeared at first blush to have little useful information on ratings, so including these genres have have merely increased the computational complexity of the model without improving its ability to accurately predict movie ratings. 

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
#calculate  pearson pair-wise correlations between each genre and ratings
genres_ratings_correlations<-t(cor(edx$rating,select(edx,genres_), 
                                   method = 'pearson')) 

#reformat the correlation coefficients into a sorted table
genres_ratings_correlations<- data.frame(genre=
                                           rownames(genres_ratings_correlations),
                                           correlation_coeff=
                                           genres_ratings_correlations[,1]) %>% 
    mutate(rank=rank(desc(correlation_coeff))) %>%
    arrange(rank)
kable(genres_ratings_correlations, 
      caption="Correlation Coefficients for Genre Correlations to Ratings")

#get list of genres to drop from the dataframe 
genres_to_drop <- genres_ratings_correlations %>% 
  filter(abs(correlation_coeff)<.02) %>% 
  .$genre
genres_to_keep <- genres_ratings_correlations %>% 
  filter(abs(correlation_coeff)>=.02) %>% 
  .$genre

edx <- select(edx, -c(all_of(genres_to_drop)))
validation <- select(validation, -c(all_of(genres_to_drop)))

#create train and test sets balanced on movie title. 
train_index <- createDataPartition(edx$title, times = 1, p=.8, list = F)
train <- edx[train_index,]
test <- edx[-train_index,]

#add columns for the movie's average rating and the user's average rating
train <- train %>% group_by(title) %>% mutate(movie_avg=mean(rating))  
train <- train %>% group_by(userId) %>% mutate(user_avg=mean(rating))

#remove unneeded objects from global environment to save memory space
rm(edx, train_index, titles_genres, highest_rated, lowest_rated)
rm(genres, rating_, genres_ratings_correlations, ratings_sortable, ratings, 
   splits, genre, genre_levels)
```

# Methods   

## Baseline Models  
Before applying various ML techniques, the performance of several simple models was estimated to establish a baseline of RMSEs to use to evaluate whether applying ML techniques meaningfully improved rating predictions. The following code was used to create tables to store and compare the RMSEs for each modeling method and to store the predictions from each method.  

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#create empty tables where rmse results for each model will be stored  
train_rmse_table<-data.frame(model=character(0),rmse=double(0))
test_rmse_table<-data.frame(model=character(0),rmse=double(0))
validation_rmse_table<-data.frame(model=character(0),rmse=double(0))

#create dataframes where the y-hats from each model will be stored  
train_results<-data.frame(title=train$title,rating=train$rating)
test_results<-data.frame(title=test$title,rating=test$rating)
validation_results<-select(validation,c(title,userId,rating))
```

**Random Guesses.** The first baseline, non-ML model examined was a model that randomly guesses movie ratings. This approach assumed all possible rating had the same probability of occurring. This random guessing method was expected to perform the worst and have the highest RMSE because this method did not base its predictions on any information gleaned from the training data. 

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#create list of possible ratings
poss_ratings<-seq(.5,5,.5)

#use random sample of possible ratings to generate predicted ratings and RMSEs
train_results[["y_hat_random_guesses"]]<-
  sample(poss_ratings, nrow(train),replace = T)

train_rmse_table[nrow(train_rmse_table)+1,]<-
  c("random_guesses", 
    RMSE(train_results$y_hat_random_guesses, 
         train_results$rating))

test_results[["y_hat_random_guesses"]]<-
  sample(poss_ratings, nrow(test),replace = T)

test_rmse_table[nrow(test_rmse_table)+1,]<-
  c("random_guesses", 
    RMSE(test_results$y_hat_random_guesses, 
         test_results$rating))
 
validation_results[["y_hat_random_guesses"]]<-
  sample(poss_ratings, nrow(validation), replace = T)

validation_rmse_table[nrow(validation_rmse_table)+1,]<-
  c("random_guesses", 
    RMSE(validation_results$y_hat_random_guesses, 
         validation_results$rating))
```

**Weighted Guesses.** This method also randomly assigns predicted ratings for each movie, but this method assumed each particular rating level had a specific probability of occurring, judging from the differential frequency of ratings observed in the training data. This method therefore estimated the probability that each rating should be selected for predictions based on that the proportion of movies that received that rating in the training data. In other words, the training data was used to estimated the prior probability of each rating level. 

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#estimate the proportion of observations in the training data that have each rating level
probs<-train %>% group_by(rating) %>% 
  summarize(prob_per_rating=as.double(n()/nrow(train)))

#assign predictions at each rating level according their priors and find RMSEs
train_results[["y_hat_weighted_guesses"]]<-
  sample(poss_ratings, nrow(train), replace = T, prob=c(probs$prob_per_rating))

train_rmse_table[nrow(train_rmse_table)+1,]<-
  c("weighted_guesses", 
    RMSE(train_results$y_hat_weighted_guesses, 
         train_results$rating))

test_results[["y_hat_weighted_guesses"]]<-
  sample(poss_ratings, nrow(test), replace = T, prob=c(probs$prob_per_rating))

test_rmse_table[nrow(test_rmse_table)+1,]<-
  c("weighted_guesses", 
    RMSE(test_results$y_hat_weighted_guesses,
         test_results$rating))

validation_results[["y_hat_weighted_guesses"]]<-
  sample(poss_ratings, nrow(validation), replace = T, prob=c(probs$prob_per_rating))

validation_rmse_table[nrow(validation_rmse_table)+1,]<-
  c("weighted_guesses",
     RMSE(validation_results$y_hat_weighted_guesses, validation_results$rating))
```

**Global Average.** The next baseline model used the overall average rating observed in the training data to predict all ratings in the test and validation data. The average rating of all observations in the training set was `r mean(train$rating)`, which in this baseline method was the predicted rating for all observations in the test and validation sets.

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#make predictions solely from overall average rating in the training dataset
train_results[["y_hat_global_mean"]]<-mean(train$rating)
train_rmse_table<-rbind(train_rmse_table,c("global_mean", 
                                           RMSE(train_results$y_hat_global_mean,
                                                train_results$rating)))

test_results[["y_hat_global_mean"]]<-mean(train$rating)
test_rmse_table<-rbind(test_rmse_table,c("global_mean", 
                                         RMSE(test_results$y_hat_global_mean,
                                              test_results$rating)))

validation_results[["y_hat_global_mean"]]<-mean(train$rating)
validation_rmse_table<-rbind(validation_rmse_table,
                             c("global_mean", 
                               RMSE(validation_results$y_hat_global_mean,
                                    validation_results$rating)))
```

**Movie Average.** This method calculated each movie's average rating in the training data, and then used each movie's estimated average rating to predict the movie's ratings in the test and validation datasets.  This method assumed that the users in the training and testing sets gave the same average rating to the same movies.

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
#group the training dataset by movie and calculate average rating for each movie
train <- train %>% group_by(title) %>% mutate(movie_avg=mean(rating))  
```
```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#predict ratings based on the movie's average rating in the training dataset 
train_results[["y_hat_movie_mean"]]<-train$movie_avg
train_rmse_table<-rbind(train_rmse_table,c("movie_mean", 
                                           RMSE(train_results$y_hat_movie_mean,
                                                train_results$rating)))

#create table listing each movie's average rating in the training dataset
avg_ratings<-train %>% ungroup() %>% select(c("movie_avg","title"))
avg_ratings<-distinct(avg_ratings)

#predict ratings based on each movie's average ratings in the training data
test <- left_join(test, avg_ratings, by="title")
test_results<-left_join(test_results, avg_ratings, by="title")

#rename the column to match naming convention used in the results tables
colnames(test_results)[which(colnames(test_results) == 'movie_avg')] <- 
  'y_hat_movie_mean'
test_rmse_table<-rbind(test_rmse_table,c("movie_mean", 
                                         RMSE(test_results$y_hat_movie_mean,
                                              test_results$rating)))

#repeat this prediction method for the validation set 
validation <- left_join(validation, avg_ratings, by="title")
validation_results <- left_join(validation_results, avg_ratings, by="title")

#for any movies in the validation dataset that weren't in the training dataset,
#predict rating based on overall average rating from the training observations
validation$movie_avg[is.na(validation$movie_avg)] <-mean(train$rating)
validation_results$movie_avg[is.na(validation_results$movie_avg)] <-mean(train$rating)

#rename the column to match naming convention used in the results tables
names(validation_results)[which(names(validation_results) == 'movie_avg')] <- 
  'y_hat_movie_mean'
validation_rmse_table<-rbind(validation_rmse_table,
                             c("movie_mean", 
                               RMSE(validation_results$y_hat_movie_mean,
                                    validation_results$rating)))
```
```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
#merge the user_avg data and use userId as the merge key
user_avgs<-train %>% ungroup() %>% select(c("user_avg", "userId"))
user_avgs<-distinct(user_avgs)
test <- left_join(test, user_avgs, by="userId")
test$user_avg[is.na(test$user_avg)] <- mean(train$rating)
validation <- left_join(validation, user_avgs, by="userId")
validation$user_avg[is.na(validation$user_avg)] <- mean(train$rating)

#clean up the workspace
rm(probs,poss_ratings)
```

## Machine Learning Approaches 

Four machine learning methods were created and optimized to determine which achieved the best RMSE. 

**Regularization.** The first ML method tested was regularization, which takes observation groups with small sample sizes and shifts their estimated ratings toward the overall rating mean.  In this way, regularization helped reduce the effect of outliers, such as movies and genres with only a few ratings and such as users who only rated a few movies.

The regularization approach applied here regularized movie rating based on three main factors: number of ratings *by movie*, the number of ratings *by user*, and the number of ratings *by genre*. Predicted ratings for movies, users, and genres with relatively few observations were shifted toward the mean rating.  A range of regularization parameters (lambda) was tested to determine the optimal extent to which the ratings should be shifted towards the overall mean. 

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}

#save the average rating from the training set as overall_mean 
overall_mean<-mean(train$rating)

#create a list of lambdas to test
lambdas <- seq(4, 6, .25)

#use sapply to create a list of RMSEs achieved by each lambda
regularization_results<-sapply(lambdas,function(lambda){
  
  #create list of regularized movie effects
  reg_effects <<- train %>% 
    group_by(title) %>% 
    #all column for the overall mean rating
    mutate(overall_mean=overall_mean) %>%
    mutate(movie_effect = sum(rating - overall_mean)/(n()+lambda))

  #create list of regularized user effects
  reg_effects <<- reg_effects %>% 
    group_by(userId) %>% 
    mutate(user_effect = sum(rating - overall_mean - movie_effect)/(n()+lambda))  
  
  #add list of regularized genre effects by looping through the list of genres
  reg_effects_copy <<- reg_effects
  genre_effects <<- data.frame(matrix(NA,ncol=1,nrow=nrow(train)))[-1]
  for (genre in genres_to_keep){
    #sum all of the genre effects that have been calculated so far
    reg_effects_copy$cumulative_genre_effects<-rowSums(genre_effects)
    
    #estimate the effect of the genre currently in the loop
    genre_eff <- reg_effects_copy %>% 
      group_by_(genre) %>% 
      mutate(genre_effect = sum(rating - 
                                  overall_mean - 
                                  movie_effect - 
                                  user_effect - 
                                  cumulative_genre_effects)/(n()+lambda)) %>%
      .$genre_effect

**K-Modes Clustering and Stepwise Regression.** The winners of the 2009 Netflix Challenges used a clustering method to group movies into clusters of similar movies, which allowed the winning team to substantially improve their rating predictions.  The exact clustering method they used remains unknown, but the code below represents an attempt to use clustering to improve predictions. A popular clustering method is known as k-means clustering, which sorts observations into clusters of observations with similar values for k-dimensional parameters of interest.  K-means clustering is designed for k-dimensional continuous data, and a similar method known as k-modes was designed for categorical and boolean data.  Here we applied the k-modes method because our genre membership columns for each genre were boolean. 

In the code below, *k* specifies the number of clusters created. The optimal *k* is somewhat subjective, but it is generally considered to occur in the "elbow" in the graph of *k* vs *SSD* (the sum of squared differences among the observations in each cluster).  This elbow occurs indicates the general value of *k* at which increasing the number of clusters would not significantly improve cohesion within clusters. In this context, cohesion is defined as the sum of within-cluster differences, which is a way of measuring overall similarity of observations in any given cluster. The theory is that clusters with highly similar observations generally will yield better cluster-based predictions.

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
set.seed(1)  

#create list of possible values of k 
k=seq(2,20,1)

#calculate the within-cluster sum of squares differences (ssd) for each k

  kms<-kmodes(genres_matrix[2:ncol(genres_matrix)], k_, iter.max = 1, 
              weighted = FALSE, fast = T)

    #calculate and return the sum of squared errors among rows of each cluster
  sum(kms$withindiff)/nrow(genres_matrix)
})

avgs <- train %>% ungroup() %>% select(c("userId","genre_cluster",
                                         "genre_cluster_user_avg"))
avgs <- distinct(avgs)

#join the genres_cluster_user_avg average from the train to test data
test <- left_join(test,avgs,by=c("userId","genre_cluster"))
validation <- left_join(validation,avgs,by=c("userId","genre_cluster"))

#assign the mean average rating to any observations with NA
train$genre_cluster_user_avg[is.na(train$genre_cluster_user_avg)] <- 
  mean(train$rating)
validation$genre_cluster_user_avg[is.na(validation$genre_cluster_user_avg)] <- 
  mean(train$rating)
test$genre_cluster_user_avg[is.na(test$genre_cluster_user_avg)] <- 
  mean(train$rating)
validation$user_avg[is.na(validation$user_avg)] <- 
  mean(train$rating)

#clean up the work space by removing objects we don't need anymore
rm(avgs, clusters, genre_clusters, best_k, k, ssd)
```

After each user's average cluster rating was appended to the datasets, a stepwise regression method was applied. This method is a ML technique that takes a list of possible parameters and builds a linear regression model that contains the combination of parameters that achieves the optimal model fit (i.e., achieves the lowest RMSE). The variables included in this project's stepwise regression method included the movie's average rating from all users, the average rating that each user gave to all movies they rated, user's cluster average rating, and the genre columns.

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
#create a truncated df with just cols used in the stepwise regression
train <- train %>% ungroup() %>% select(-c("userId", "movie_year", 
                                           "rating_year", 
                                           "title","movieId",
                                           "genres","timestamp"))
test <- test %>% ungroup() %>% select(-c("userId","movie_year", 
                                         "rating_year", "title",
                                         "movieId","genres",
                                         "timestamp"))
validation <- validation %>% ungroup() %>% select(-c("userId", "movie_year", 
                                                     "rating_year",   
                                                     "title","movieId",
                                                     "genres","timestamp"))
```

Because this stepwise regression method is computationally intensive, it was run on a subset of one fifth (20%) of the observations in the training and test datasets. The sample index was generated using the following code.  R's train() method by default performs 25 bootstrap resamples.

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#take sample of observations from the train set
sample_shrinkage_factor <- 5
sample_index<-sample(seq(1,nrow(train),1),
                     nrow(train)/sample_shrinkage_factor, 
                     replace = F)
train_results_sample<-train_results[sample_index,]

#now take sample for test set
test_sample_index<-sample(seq(1,nrow(test),1),
                          nrow(test)/(sample_shrinkage_factor), 
                          replace = F)
test_results_sample<-test_results[test_sample_index,]
```

The model was fit using the following code.

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#estimate the best stepwise regression model based on 25 bootstraps
best_stepwise_fit<-train(rating ~ ., 
                         method = "leapSeq", 
                         data = train[sample_index,],
                         tuneGrid=data.frame(nvmax=seq(1,ncol(train)-1,1)))
```

#summarize the predictors in the final model. 
summary(best_stepwise_fit$finalModel)

#the optimal number of predictors is:

#append the predictions to the results datasets

  predict(best_stepwise_fit, test[test_sample_index,])

                        c("stepwise_regression",
                          min(best_stepwise_fit$results$RMSE)))

                                    validation_results$rating)))
```

**KNN and Random Forest Methods.** In addition to the aforementioned methods, k-nearest neighbor clustering (knn) and a random forest method were attempted but excluded from the final analysis because these two methods were too computationally intensive to execute quickly on a standard computer.  Both of these methods were attempted on a subset of about 5% of the observations in the edx training and test datasets. The code needed for these methods is included in the appendix.

The estimated RMSE for the random forest model was RMSE=0.88961, and the estimated RMSE for the knn model was RMSE=0.94775. The RMSE for an ensemble method combining these methods with regularization and stepwise regression was RMSE=0.86467 when estimated from the edx datasets. However, the RMSE was substantially higher (RMSE=1.16020) when the ensemble model was applied to the validation dataset.  This disparity in the RMSE observed on the edx and validation datasets probably arose because the models were overtrained on the relatively small sample of 5% of observations taken from the edx dataset;  the training data sample had too few observations to fit a model generalizable to the larger validation dataset.

**Ensemble Model.** An ensemble model was estimated by testing whether averaging the predictions of one or more of the aforementioned methods would reduce the overall RMSE. A key assumption underpinning ensemble modeling methods is that any given method will yield predictions with errors that *are normally distributed* around the true value of the predicted variable.  Therefore, averaging the predictions of multiple models should in theory reduce overall RMSE by shifting the predictions toward the true values of the predicted parameter.

```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#rank the modeling methods according to their RMSEs
test_rmse_table[["rank"]]<-as.integer(rank(test_rmse_table$rmse))

#create a list of possible number of models
poss_num_models <- seq(2,nrow(test_rmse_table),1)

#estimate the RMSEs for ensemble models with various numbers of models included
rmses<- sapply(poss_num_models,function(poss_models){
  models_to_keep <- test_rmse_table %>% filter(rank<poss_models)
  results_to_keep <- lapply(list(models_to_keep$model), function(k){
    paste("y_hat",k,sep="_")
  })
  
  #average the models kept and calculate RMSE
  y_hat_meta_model_test <- rowMeans(select(test_results_sample,
                                           c(unlist(results_to_keep))))
  RMSE(y_hat_meta_model_test, test_results_sample$rating)
})
```

The one or more models listed in the table below were determined to be either the single model, when taken alone, or the *combination* of models that achieved the lowest RMSE.

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
#show which ensemble minimizes RMSE
which.min(rmses)

#generate list of models to keep for the ensemble model
models_to_keep <- test_rmse_table %>% filter(rank<=which.min(rmses))
results_to_keep <- lapply(list(models_to_keep$model), function(k){
  paste("y_hat",k,sep="_")

  select(test_results_sample,c(unlist(results_to_keep))))
validation_results[["y_hat_meta_model"]]<-rowMeans(
  select(validation_results,c(unlist(results_to_keep))))

#append RMSEs to RMSE tables
train_rmse_table<-rbind(train_rmse_table,c("meta_model", RMSE(train_results_sample$y_hat_meta_model,train_results_sample$rating)))
test_rmse_table<-rbind(test_rmse_table,c("meta_model", RMSE(test_results_sample$y_hat_meta_model,test_results_sample$rating)))
final_rmse_table<-test_rmse_table
validation_rmse_table<-rbind(validation_rmse_table,c("meta_model", RMSE(validation_results$y_hat_meta_model,validation_results$rating)))
```

# Results  

The table below lists the final RMSEs for each individual modeling method, as well as the best ensemble method.  Regularization performed the best, with an *RMSE of 0.86434*. The ensemble method in the table below lists a slightly lower RMSE, but this lower RMSE occurred because the ensemble method eliminated some rows from the dataset if they had any NA values. As show in the ensemble model analysis in the previous section, adding additional models to the regularization model did not improve overall model accuracy, so the best ensemble model only included predictions derived from the regularization model.

Of the four ML methods examined here, three (regularization, stepwise regression, and random forest) achieved RMSEs that were lower than the best baseline non-ML model (the movie mean model with RMSE=0.94258). This demonstrated that using ML methods can help us to achieve better predictions that those generated by non-ML approaches.

# Conclusion  

This project achieved its overall goal by designing a ML model that predicted movie ratings with an *RMSE of 0.86434*, which met the goal of attaining a final RMSE < 0.86490. After comparing several non-ML and four ML methods, it was determined that the best method for predicting ratings was the regularization method, which predicted ratings based on the regularization effects by movie, user, and genres.  This regularization method was computationally simple, and it achieved an RMSE=0.86434, which was superior to more complex ML methods and superior to any multi-method ensemble models that combined predictions from the various individual models examined here.  Overall, this project demonstrates that simple ML approaches can help produce accurate, efficient recommendation systems, which have become an important part of modern life in general and cinema experiences in particular in the age of big data.
